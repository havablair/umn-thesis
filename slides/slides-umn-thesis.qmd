## Welcome

## About me

-   Research in soil science and agriculture
-   Year 4 PhD student
-   Starting learning R in 2019

## Motivations

-   Practical: less time and tears on repetitive formatting, updating
-   Philosophical: Your code and analysis IS a research output

::: notes
Practical: set up a structure that ultimately saves you time spent on tedious formatting, copy pasting, etc. and allows you to focus on your work.
PLUS you are building skills to be able to work in many other formats (HTML! Presentations! Build your own website!)

Philosophical or Professional?
(Conduct of Research): Contribute to an ecosystem of reproducible, open science

What does your research consist of?
What are the outputs of your research?
The analysis is PART of your research output, even if this is not something we explicitly see in published papers (although that is changing)
