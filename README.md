- **quarto titelpages v1** : I adapted their `thesis-static` title page, and downloaded `before-body.tex` and `in-header.tex` from their [github repo](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages_v1). Also, [their documentation](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/quarto_titlepages_v1/) is incredibly helpful for understanding more generally what is going on (I have never used LaTeX before this!)
